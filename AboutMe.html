    <h2>Bio:</h2>
    <div class="bio">
      After growing up in what was a small town of lake Stevens WA, I quickly found myself working in the Food packing industry.
      I first started out as a salesman, making cold calls, sending potential clients emails hoping I can get a sell.
      I quickly found out I absolutly hated this and was not what I saw myself doing for a long time. So I found myself in a new job postion as a Tech.
      This is the job I have now and see myself doing this job for a long time. I have no education after HighSchool as I never was interested in school and thought it was a waste of time
      My goal for going to Code Fellows is to understand how to read and write code.
      The industry I am in companies are qucikly switching to coding automation and I wanna be able to futher help my company with
      having someone in house who knows how to program.
