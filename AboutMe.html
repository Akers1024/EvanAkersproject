    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <div class="bio">
      <p>After growing up in what was a small town of lake Stevens WA, I quickly found myself working in the Food packing industry.
       I first started out as a salesman, making cold calls, sending potential clients emails hoping I can get a sell.
       I quickly found out I absolutly hated this and was not what I saw myself doing for a long time. So I found myself in a new job postion as a Tech.
       This is the job I have now and see myself doing this job for a long time. I have no education after HighSchool as I never was interested in school and thought it was a waste of time
       My goal for going to Code Felllows is to understand how to read and write code.
       The industry I am in companies are qucikly switching to coding automation and I wanna be able to futher help my company with
       having someone in house who knows how to program.
